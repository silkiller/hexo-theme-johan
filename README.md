# Hexo Theme Modifications Documentation

## Overview
This document provides information about the modifications made to the `hexo-theme-oasis_updated` theme to implement a timeline-style archive page and tag cloud visualization similar to Lilian Weng's blog.

## Changes Made

### 1. Archive Page
- Implemented a timeline-style layout that groups posts by year and month
- Added post count indicators for each year and month
- Improved the visual hierarchy with proper indentation and styling
- Added metadata display (date, author) for each post

### 2. Tag Page
- Implemented a tag cloud visualization where tag size reflects frequency
- Added tag count indicators
- Created a responsive grid layout for tags
- Maintained the theme's original styling

### 3. New Files Added
- `source/css/archive.styl`: Styles for the timeline-style archive page
- `source/css/tag.styl`: Styles for the tag cloud visualization

### 4. Modified Files
- `layout/archive.pug`: Updated to implement timeline grouping
- `layout/tag.pug`: Updated to implement tag cloud visualization

## Usage Notes

### Archive Page
The archive page will automatically group your posts by year and month in a timeline format. No additional configuration is needed.

### Tag Cloud
The tag cloud will display on the main tags page, with tag sizes proportional to their usage frequency. Individual tag pages will display posts with that specific tag.

**Note:** In some Hexo configurations, the main `/tags/` route may not be generated by default. If you encounter a 404 error when accessing `/tags/`, you may need to add the following to your site's `_config.yml`:

```yaml
tag_dir: tags
tag_generator:
  per_page: 10
  enable_index_page: true
```

## Testing
The modifications have been tested with a sample Hexo blog and confirmed to work with the standard Hexo configuration. The timeline-style archive and tag pages render correctly and maintain the theme's original styling.

## Compatibility
These modifications are compatible with Hexo 5.x and above. They maintain the original theme's responsive design and should work well on both desktop and mobile devices.
